    <!-- For this excercise the entire game is to be played in the console, meaning the page itself will be blank. However, it seems like a fun additional exercise to come back at some point and set up a GUI.

    <!-- My first run at this problem was completely blind; I did not read any of the instructions as I wanted to try this without hints. However, after completing the project I went back to look at the assignment instructions and I can see that:
    
    a) They wanted me to use specific variable names for certain variables, and
    
    b) They wanted me to include certain features that I did not include, and some features that I did include were beyond what they wanted.

    Accordingly, I am updating my project.-->
